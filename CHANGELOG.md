## 0.9.0 - 2016-01-30

* Updated to use Guzzle 6 and PSR-7.
* Event system has been replaced with a middleware system
    * Middleware at the command layer work the same as middleware from the
      HTTP layer, but work with `Command` and `Result` objects instead of
      `Request` and `Response` objects
    * The command middleware is in a separate `HandlerStack` instance than the
      HTTP middleware.
* `Result` objects are the result of executing a `Command` and are used to hold
  the parsed response data.
* Asynchronous code now uses the `guzzlehttp/promises` package instead of
  `guzzlehttp/ringphp`, which means that asynchronous results are implemented
  as Promises/A+ compliant `Promise` objects, instead of futures.
* The existing `Subscriber`s were removed.
* The `ServiceClientInterface` and `ServiceClient` class now provide the basic
  foundation of a web service client.
